# Description

Small library for reading WiFi signal data from an iOS enabled device. It works only on 
version 3.x, and 4.x. It links on runtime the library for handling the NIC (for WiFi), 
since the library is not available for static linking on compile time.

This library is considered to be a private library according to Apple, so don't use 
it on any "app" that is intended for Apple's App Store, because it will be rejected.
